* Each Question folder has their code to solve those problem statements. 
* Each answer has been provided with execution procedure to explain the approach of using those code files. 
* Caching Web API has been developed in a MVC style.  

# Question 1:
    * Used Python3 for data handling. 
    * Program can work on argument pairs of 32 bit unsigned IP addresses and Subnet.

      were written In an useful fashion to an outputfile, when both specified on through the STDIN.  
    * Has a couple of default Unit Test cases present when no system arguments passed. 

# Question 2:
